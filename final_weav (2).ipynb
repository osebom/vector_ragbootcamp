Theres no notification in your bank or like an email or anything saying that theyre doing the maintenance so if you make any deposit after the certain time, they hold it until  time 3 AM That would be fine if you were notified if you knew that was gonna happen right so you could be on the side of the road and expecting to be able to get gas but no youre screwed and customer service.

It took me almost a month just to set up my account and have another bank added so I could transfer funds in, when this would typically take about a week or less at another bank. Constant delays and follow ups are required, their systems are NOT user friendly e.g. adding a bank to bank transfer requires you mailing in a form, and you can only complete it by email if you call in to request.

I deposited a cheque through the mobile deposit app. Understandably, they placed a hold on the funds, upon doing so they also put a hold on ALL funds I had prior to deposit. I contacted them and I was told that was a mistake and would be corrected within 24 hours, which it was. When I checked my account a couple days later to see if my cheque cleared, I noticed yet again ALL funds were being held again. I called again to see what was going on, the guy I spoke with this time was rude, dismissive, and very condescending. He spoke to me like I was a complete idiot. He told me that every night when the system is updating funds will show unavailable.\n",

That didnt make sense to me, as like I have said I have been a member for 20 years and have never had this happen before. He then just started repeating to me over and over the amount of the cheque that I deposited and said that they are holding it because it was a large deposit. He just kept yelling you deposited a cheque for X, what did you think was going to happen? I told him I understood the hold of the cheque, what I was not understanding why all my funds were being held, at random times. I waited a week, and the cheque still would not be released to me. I contacted my lawyer who issued me the money and I was told that the money had cleared from the trust account 2 days after I had deposited the money into my account, so there should be no reason for the hold to continue.\n",

I was transferred over and over to different departments on the phone, each person telling me they were the wrong department and theyd have to transfer me again. I have been hung up on and yelled at multiple times by customer service agents. And still, no one would give me any information about my money. Finally, last week I managed to speak to a supervisor who told me that the money WAS refunded to me, way back in December, but it was accidentally sent to the old card the one that I was told to destroy because it was compromised rather than my new card.\n",

            "Answer: The reviewer's experiences with Simplii's systems are marred by frequent failures and inefficiencies. They often find themselves unable to access their funds, with holds being placed on their accounts for extended periods of time. This is evident in the numerous complaints about delayed or stuck transactions, including transfers between Simplii accounts. The reviewer's frustration with these issues is compounded by the lack of effective communication and resolution from Simplii's customer service team. As a result, the reviewer feels that their money is \"stuck in limbo\" and that they are unable to use it when they need to. This consistent pattern of system failures and poor customer service contributes significantly to the reviewer's overwhelmingly negative sentiment towards Simplii.\n",

The bank's automated system requires customers to wait for an extended period of time, in some cases up to 47 minutes, before being able to speak to a representative.
