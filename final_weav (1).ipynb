I went to pay for my insurance and it just refused to work because the bill was about 1000. Quite inconvenient.Even worse, there is 200 daily withdrawal limit with no possibilities of increasing it more. Thats insane! So, if you need cash, you cannot retrieve it from there unless you go to the local  for multiple days in a row.That said, it could work okay if maybe you dont earn very much, or are looking for a secondary bank. Some people have accounts in more than two banks, that can be convenient my main one is mostly for savings and expensive purchases while  one is more for general shopping  groceries, , bills for phone and internet.

Every time I have tried to get anything done with  setting up my online banking account, adding a bank for bank to bank transfer it was delayed because actions would take several business days, and once the time is up and you call to follow up you realize that no progress was made. It took me almost a month just to set up my account and have another bank added so I could transfer funds in, when this would typically take about a week or less at another bank. Constant delays and follow ups are required, their systems are NOT user friendly e.g. adding a bank to bank transfer requires you mailing in a form, and you can only complete it by email if you call in to request.

Its been two weeks and now theres a postal strike, so Ill likely miss a substantial amount of interest.  and their response was that due to the postal strike they may just not send out cards period but they didnt offer me a way to access my account!\n",

Why do I have to use money earlier than I should??Other than no fees when you do everything their way, get ready for aggravation and headaches!!!!!\n",

Some people have accounts in more than two banks, that can be convenient my main one is mostly for savings and expensive purchases while  one is more for general shopping  groceries, , bills for phone and internet. In terms of online purchases,  is winning over  which, unfortunately, does not work with majority of online marketplaces.

We now have to go to another bank, pay huge business account fees, and now pay all our bills from another bank. mplii wouldnt allow us to endorse our checks either, nothing with our business name on it, even if it has our own personal name on it as well.

My error on the wire instructions was indicating as the recipient name instead of my personal account name, as the form didnt have a separate field for receiving institution name.Instead of trying to recall right away, I waited at least a week to see if could still credit my account with the wired amount despite the mismatch on the recipient name. When I requested for the wire to be recalled from s end, and for to perform an escalated investigation, both and claimed repeatedly that they didnt know the funds whereabouts. stated that the funds arrived at Jun 9th, which was frustrating as I didnt see the incoming amount in my account. I later realized that the funds mustve been held at which relies on for its wire transfers, but I find it astounding that couldnt call to sort this issue out, claiming that the wire transfer department doesnt have a phone  to call.uses office as an intermediary bank for transfers, and uses as their intermediary for transfers in addition to for wire transfers in general.Theres no way that in this electronic age that neither nor were able to trace the whereabouts of the funds for almost a month. While was claiming that the funds havent been received on their side, it was shocking for them to say that neither they nor I had a phone  to call to speak to the relevant wire transfer team whether at or on the matter. What the staff shouldve explained is that was likely the bottleneck which I only eventually on July 6th found out was the case. How is it that couldnt call to locate the funds?Meanwhile, although was claiming that they cant call wire transfer team to locate the missing funds as their only way of communication is through the SWIFT messaging, it turns out according to , was at least relaying the recall instructions to , which was apparently ignoring the messages from , and so definitely deserves a 1 out of 5 star rating for their wire services.In sum, although the customer service staff at are friendly, providing them more training and responsibility on resolving wire transfer issues in coordination with and would go a long way.If you ever need to call s customer service line, expect a 1hr wait. A few weeks back, after waiting for almost 1hr, s automated service line disconnected the call, and I had to call a 2nd time waiting another near 1hr.My original rating has been updated as further escalated my incident and within a week of me recalling the original wired funds back to , credited my account for all of the intermediary bank charges involved with the recall. \n",

Thats how much your transaction fee cost and you dont receive it the same day unlike . If you transfer 5000 at  same day delivery, the fees is not 1000 plus you get a better rate. This bank is cheating the public and it needs to be investigated. They allow you to send 3000050000 within 24hrs hence they make a lot of profit and are encouraging money laundering.\n",

I deposited a cheque through the mobile deposit app. Understandably, they placed a hold on the funds, upon doing so they also put a hold on ALL funds I had prior to deposit. I contacted them and I was told that was a mistake and would be corrected within 24 hours, which it was. When I checked my account a couple days later to see if my cheque cleared, I noticed yet again ALL funds were being held again. I called again to see what was going on, the guy I spoke with this time was rude, dismissive, and very condescending. He spoke to me like I was a complete idiot. He told me that every night when the system is updating funds will show unavailable. That didnt make sense to me, as like I have said I have been a member for 20 years and have never had this happen before. He then just started repeating to me over and over the amount of the cheque that I deposited and said that they are holding it because it was a large deposit. He just kept yelling you deposited a cheque for X, what did you think was going to happen? I told him I understood the hold of the cheque, what I was not understanding why all my funds were being held, at random times. I waited a week, and the cheque still would not be released to me. I contacted my lawyer who issued me the money and I was told that the money had cleared from the trust account 2 days after I had deposited the money into my account, so there should be no reason for the hold to continue. I then contacted  again to figure out what was going on with the cheque and if they could clear it manually as I know the money has been cleared by the other account. The woman I spoke with this time then informed me that not only had the funds not been released but they also added on an extra holding extension so it would take even longer. When I asked to speak to the department that makes the decisions I was told that wasnt possible. \n",

Just the fact they phoned me a day after my closingpossession date says they have zero clue...With all due respect to those that work there....for us customers... we get what we pay for. haha and we pay zero!The adjudicator haha, asking for this and that document every two days or so... after about 10 days I pulled the pin. I went to a real bank I had approval under 24 hours and documents to my solicitor in under 4 business days ... seriously. Because my mortgage specialist at the bank was a professional and knew what she was doing..Anyway... again, ... you have been warned.Sure.. they may be able to approve a mortgage and get solicitor documents in 21 days .... but that buffer is needed because they have no clue.I want high performance, knowledgeable people I deal with at a bank.Not fumbling, unsure, pretenders. Sure we all have to learn... but not while pretending to the client as proficient bankers and adjudicator.

The mortgage specialist approved me right away and after that, I seldom heard from her for over 3 months. I sent them multiple emails and all required documents very early on in the process and implored for them to return my emails as we were passing the 3 month mark and still, nothing was happening. The mortgage specialist said she would make my file a top priority with the underwriters and that I would hear back from her within a week. 3 more weeks went by without a word from her until I finally emailed said specialist again and told her that if I didnt hear from her by the end of the week that I would withdraw my application. She immediately wrote back and said she would get back to me in a couple of days and once again, 2 weeks went by and not a word from her. I was very frustrated with all of this and the lack of replies from [[[[TED]]]], so I finally began to include the lawyer that they insisted I retain, in all correspondence with [[[[TED]]]]. I advised the lawyer of my frustration and he tried twice to get ahold of them to get this moving and he, too, was not successful. I finally recieved an abrupt email telling me that my application had been denied and to have a nice day. After this, I called another national flagship bank and had an hour long meeting and everything that took [[[[TED]]]] 3 months to not even be able to complete was done in less than an hour at this much more professional bank. I do not recommend [[[[TED]]]] for banking of ANY kind, including personal banking and mortgage financing. Unfortunately, I am still on the hook with [[[[TED]]]] for my mortgage for one more year, but as soon as that year is up, I will never have anything to do with [[[[TED]]]] ever, ever again.\n",

I have called and spoken to over 20 different people, who all kept telling me its still under investigation and that they couldnt give me more information. I was transferred over and over to different departments on the phone, each person telling me they were the wrong department and theyd have to transfer me again. I have been hung up on and yelled at multiple times by customer service agents. And still, no one would give me any information about my money. Finally, last week I managed to speak to a supervisor who told me that the money WAS refunded to me, way back in December, but it was accidentally sent to the old card the one that I was told to destroy because it was compromised rather than my new card. I dont know how or why that happened, or why none of the 20 people I spoke to caught that mistake. Why did they keep saying it was still under investigation then? He assured me that he would personally make sure the money was transferred from the old card to the new one. Well, it has now been over a week since that conversation and I still do not have my money back! I tried to do a live chat this morning with their customer service team, and the agent told me if the money went to the old card it wouldve automatically appeared on my new card. When I said it didnt, that I still do not have it, he ended the chat without helping me, without warning, while I was still typing out a second message. I then had to call in, while in tears, to speak to someone on the phone. That person gave me a bunch of clearly fake apologies and confirmed that the money is still just sitting on my old card, unusable. Supposedly, that person will personally make sure I get the money back today. Ive heard that before so I will believe it when I see it.

She stated that THEY FEEL that I was sending and receiving too many online payments Through  and  ETransferThis put me into further shock. Especially during COVID19, where people are doing online banking transactions, more than anytime in history!! She said  is a nofee banking service and not a business account.I quickly told her, this is not a business account. I am a collector of sports cards and memorabilia. I buy and sometimes sell things on ebay and private sales. This is not a business, no more than someone making a private sale for their car, or even a yard sale.It seems she did not understand the concept of being a collector in terms of buying and selling.I knew they have made up their minds in this, so there was no point in fighting it, especially when they dont understand the concept of ebaycollectables. So she said she will send me the remaining balance of my money in my account  263.48 as a cheque and will be sent out right away, so the account can be closed and finalized.Today June 19, 2020, I still have not received my owed monies.I just called customer service and spoke to , who is a Manager. She confirmed to me that the account still has NOT been closed and that no cheque has been sent out, as of yet.THIS IS NOW FAUDULENT!

In the meantime, I received a letter from  for my late husband, telling him he had a dormant account!! I contacted the manager, she apologized and said she would look into it.I received an email to tell me the money was in the account and if there is anything I need help to contact her. I emailed and asked where is the rest of the accounts, she had no idea about the other accounts?! Are you kidding me? She then informed me I had to sign more paperwork and that she could look at his chequing  savings and TFSA but, I would have to call !Now, forgive me if I am wrong but, logic tells me if your husband dies, you send all the appropriate paperwork, listing all the accounts and where they should go, it is someones job to deal with that customer and sort out all the accounts of the estate.

She sees my ID uploaded last Wednesday and will call to get it fixed, should be okay by Thursday. Why have agents answering the phone that cant even help you???2of3On several occasions they cashed postdated cheques and charged me overdraft and interest, and refused to reverse the charges even though they admitted cheque was postdated. Their advice was to tell the person not to deposit the cheque before the date????3of3I used the feature that allows you to transfer money between accounts on a future date. Also used the feature to pay a bill, my rent on the first day of the month. On the first day of the month I was charged overdraft and interest because the cheque was processed first before the transfer. Customer service and customer service manager advise that is the way their system works and nothing can be done, other than I transfer the money before the day of the payment.

They often find themselves unable to access their funds, with holds being placed on their accounts for extended periods of time. This is evident in the numerous complaints about delayed or stuck transactions, including transfers between Simplii accounts. The reviewer's frustration with these issues is compounded by the lack of effective communication and resolution from Simplii's customer service team. As a result, the reviewer feels that their money is \"stuck in limbo\" and that they are unable to use it when they need to. This consistent pattern of system failures and poor customer service contributes significantly to the reviewer's overwhelmingly negative sentiment towards Simplii.\n",

The bank's automated system requires customers to wait for an extended period of time, in some cases up to 47 minutes, before being able to speak to a representative.
